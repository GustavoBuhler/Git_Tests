# 🛠️ Git Command Testing Repository

Welcome to my **Git command testing repository**!
🎉 This repository was created as part of the activities for the **Data Analysis** course at **[EBAC](ebaconline.com.br)**
🏫. Here, I practice the basics of version control using Git. 🚀

---

## ✏️ The purpose of this repository is to:

1. 🔍 Understand the main Git commands.  
2. 🚦 Practice version control workflows.  
3. 🗃️ Create, modify, and manage files and folders.  
4. 🤹‍♂️ Test different scenarios like commits, branches, merges, etc.

## 🧩 My learning objectives:

✔️ How to create a local repository.  
✔️ How to add files to the staging area and commit them.  
✔️ How to create and switch between branches.  
✔️ How to resolve simple conflicts during merges.

🚀 This is just the beginning of my journey into the world of Git and Data Analysis. 👨‍💻
